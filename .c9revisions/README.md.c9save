The project was created as part of the GSOC scheme with tremendous support and feedback from the aria2 community.\r\n\r\nVery simple to use, no build scripts, no installation scripts. First start aria2 in the background either in your local machine or in a remote one. You can do that as follows:\r\n**aria2c --enable-rpc --rpc-listen-all**\r\nIf aria2 is not installed in your local machine then head on to http://aria2.sourceforge.net/ and follow the instructions there.\r\n\r\nThen download the webui, you can either do that by downloading this repository and running index.html in the browser. Or you could just head on to http://ziahamza.github.com/webui-aria2/ and just start downloading files!! After that you can also save it for offline use by saving from the browser save page as option.\r\n\r\n\r\nStatus\r\n===========\r\nUsable but some bugs here and there. A lot more to features to come so stay tuned.\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n-----------\r\n* More advance options for new download\r\n* More specialized info for special download types like bit torrent and metalink\r\n* Adding URIs to existing downloads\r\n\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n============\r\nWell, I guess you cannot run it without aria2 installed locally or on a network location. And not sure if a web browser counts as a dependency on GUI desktops :)\r\n\r\nSupport\r\n=======\r\nFor any support, feature request and bug report add an issue in the github project tab or head on the aria2 forums (https://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/aria2) and post your issue there.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n              DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n                     Version 2, December 2004\r\n  \r\n    Copyright (C) 2004 Sam Hocevar <sam@hocevar.net>\r\n  \r\n    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim or modified\r\n    copies of this license document, and changing it is allowed as long\r\n    as the name is changed.\r\n  \r\n               DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n    \r\n    0.
