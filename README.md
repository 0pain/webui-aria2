webui-aria2
===========

The aim for this project is to create the worlds best and hottest interface to interact with aria2. aria2 is the worlds best file downloader, but sometimes the command line just brings more power than necessary.

Very simple to use, no build scripts, no installation scripts. Just download the repo, fireup your favourite web browser with index.html and start downloading files!! Be sure to start aria2 in the background either in your local machine or in a remote one. You can do that as follows:
**aria2c --enable-rpc**

If aria2 is not installed in your local machine then head on to http://aria2.sourceforge.net/ and follow the instructions there.

Status
===========
Usable but some bugs here and there. A lot more to features to come so stay tuned.

TODO
-----------
* More advance options for new download
* Add download and upload speed graphs and virtualizations
* More specialized info for special download types like bit torrent and metalink
* Adding URIs to existing downloads


Dependencies
============
Well, I guess you cannot run it without aria2 installed locally or on a network location. And not sure if a web browser counts as a dependency on GUI desktops :)
