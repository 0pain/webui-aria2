webui-aria2
===========

The aim for this project is to create the worlds best and hottest interface to interact with aria2. Aria2 is the worlds best file downloader, but sometimes the command line just brings more power than necessary.

Very simple to use, no build scripts, no installation scripts. Just download, fireup your favourite web browser and open index.html and start downloading files!!


Dependencies
===========
Well, I guess it cant run without aria2 installed locally or on a network location. And not sure if a web browser counts as a dependencies on GUI desktops :)
